## ‚úÖ 7. CI/CD Recommendation for Software Projects

To ensure consistency, quality, and security across the software development lifecycle, the organization supports two CI/CD frameworks. These are designed to align with the company‚Äôs standards and infrastructure constraints.

---

<br/>
<br/>

## 7.1. üöß Lightspeed Classic (Legacy)

**Status:** *Supported but not recommended for new applications.*

This legacy CI/CD pipeline is maintained for compatibility with applications that require **deployment on Windows servers via Udeploy**.

### 7.1.1 Continuous Integration: Jenkins

Uses a Jenkins pipeline with the following mandatory security and quality plugins:

- ‚úÖ **Sonar** ‚Äì Static code analysis and quality gates  
- ‚úÖ **Security Bot** ‚Äì General vulnerability alerts  
- ‚úÖ **Black Duck** ‚Äì Open source dependency scanning  
- ‚úÖ **Snyk** ‚Äì Vulnerability scanning for code and libraries  
- ‚úÖ **Checkmarx** ‚Äì Static/dynamic security scanning (SAST/DAST)  
- ‚úÖ **Renovate** ‚Äì Automated dependency updates  
- ‚úÖ **GEM Scan** ‚Äì Internal company compliance checks  

### 7.1.2 Continuous Delivery: Udeploy

- Udeploy is used for application deployments, particularly in **Windows-based server environments**.
- Still used by legacy apps with infrastructure constraints.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Not recommended for modern applications or containerized microservices.

## 7.2. üöÄ Lightspeed Enterprise (Recommended)

**Status:** *‚úÖ Officially recommended for all new applications.*

This modern pipeline enables robust, cloud-native CI/CD practices, especially suitable for microservices, containerized workloads, and Kubernetes-based deployments.

### 7.2.1 Continuous Integration: Tekton

A flexible, Kubernetes-native CI engine using Tekton pipelines, with enforced integration of:

- ‚úÖ **Sonar**  
- ‚úÖ **Security Bot**  
- ‚úÖ **Snyk**  
- ‚úÖ **Checkmarx**  
- ‚úÖ **Renovate**  
- ‚úÖ **GEM Scan**

These tools ensure that every code change is validated, scanned for vulnerabilities, and adheres to quality standards before progressing to delivery stages.

### 7.2.2 Continuous Delivery: Harness

Harness handles progressive delivery, with native support for:

- Canary or blue/green deployments  
- Rollback automation  
- Approval workflows  

> ‚úÖ **Note:** Lightspeed Enterprise is the **default CI/CD path** for new application development across the organization.
