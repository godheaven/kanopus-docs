## 1. Improving Non-Modularized Projects

Improvements for non-modularized software projects with large volumes of source code involve refactoring actions, reorganization, and separation of responsibilities. The goal is to transform tightly coupled and hard-to-maintain systems into scalable, maintainable, and testable solutions. These improvements include layering or modular separation, elimination of duplicated code, introduction of interfaces, use of design patterns like dependency injection, and progressive decoupling of components.

These improvements typically include:

- ✔ Separation of responsibilities (Single Responsibility Principle).
- ✔ Extraction of independent modules or services.
- ✔ Refactoring of duplicated or tangled code.
- ✔ Introduction of patterns such as layers, interfaces, or dependency injection.
- ✔ Documentation of architecture and its components.
