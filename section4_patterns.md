## 4. Software Design Patterns Guide

## ‚úÖ 4.1. Recognized Software Design Patterns

### üîß Creational Patterns
- **Singleton**: Ensures a single global instance.
- **Factory Method**: Delegates object creation to subclasses.
- **Abstract Factory**: Produces families of related objects.
- **Builder**: Step-by-step construction of complex objects.
- **Prototype**: Clones existing objects.

### üß± Structural Patterns
- **Adapter**: Converts one interface into another.
- **Bridge**: Separates abstraction from implementation.
- **Composite**: Treats individual objects and groups uniformly.
- **Decorator**: Adds behavior without modifying the original class.
- **Facade**: Provides a unified interface to subsystems.
- **Flyweight**: Shares data for efficiency.
- **Proxy**: Controls access to another object.

### üé≠ Behavioral Patterns
- **Observer**: Event subscription mechanism.
- **Strategy**: Interchangeable algorithms.
- **Command**: Encapsulates an action as an object.
- **State**: Varies behavior based on state.
- **Template Method**: Algorithm skeleton with customizable steps.
- **Chain of Responsibility**: Linked handlers.
- **Mediator**: Centralizes communication.
- **Memento**: Saves/restores state.
- **Visitor**: Adds operations to structures.
- **Interpreter**: Parses simple languages.
- **Iterator**: Traverses structures without exposing internals.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è 4.2. Software Design Anti-Patterns

- **God Object**: Classes that do too much (violate SRP).
- **Spaghetti Code**: Tangled and hard-to-follow flow.
- **Lava Flow**: Obsolete code kept due to fear of removal.
- **Shotgun Surgery**: Small changes require multiple edits across files.
- **Golden Hammer**: Using one pattern or tech for everything.
- **Boat Anchor**: Unused but retained code.
- **Reinventing the Wheel**: Rewriting what already exists and works.
- **Magic Numbers / Strings**: Contextless hardcoded values.

## üö´ Common Software Design Mistakes

- ‚ùå Using patterns without understanding their purpose.
- ‚ùå Premature or unnecessary abstractions.
- ‚ùå Adding complexity for the sake of elegance.
- ‚ùå Ignoring SOLID principles (especially SRP).
- ‚ùå Mixing responsibilities (e.g., controllers validating, processing, and querying).
- ‚ùå Poor documentation and naming.
- ‚ùå Ignoring future maintainability.
- ‚ùå Adopting architecture trends without real need.

> üìå A good architecture should be understandable, flexible, and aligned with business goals‚Äînot just ‚Äútechnically correct.‚Äù
